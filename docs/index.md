# POSOS
POS OS, an operating system on the arm architecture using an ext2 file system. This project is done in accordance to class requirements (name of class withheld to prevent plagiarism) for a final project and to be extended as a personal project to run on a Raspberry Pi 3 B+
Utilizing the contained code in a way that is considered cheating or plagiarizing is not condoned.

## Work In Progress
POSOS is a work in progress continuing since my graduation from WSU. It will be worked on periodically to further the capabilities of the OS.

### Road Map
* Piping
* IO redirection
* ext2 fs of my own
   * [ext2fs_360](https://github.com/benhamlin314/ext2fs_360)
   * mounting drives
      * rework all ext2 fs to allow mounting
